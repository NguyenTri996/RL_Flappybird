# RL_Flappybird
# Flappy Bird Deep Q-Learning Agent

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent to solve the Flappy Bird game environment using Gymnasium. The agent interacts with the game, learns to play, and continuously improves its performance.

## Project Overview

The project aims to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using reinforcement learning, specifically the Deep Q-Learning algorithm. The agent learns to perform actions based on the state it observes in the environment by receiving rewards. The model is built using PyTorch, and it leverages experience replay for stable learning.

## Environment Setup

Before running the code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed.

### 1. Install the Required Libraries

Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7+). Then, set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
